Perceptual entropy - avg no of bits/block , overall number of bits/block,
compute SMR for each band - 6dB for each SMR, find number of bits ,avg number of bits per band Pg 295, threshold of perceptual entropy is wrong in book 
Edler block switching - 133
AC2A - 136

Look ahead for transient detection, look to the next block to see if there is a transient, modify 
Send window information - 4 types of windows (start transition, short, long, stop transition), 2 bits needed
